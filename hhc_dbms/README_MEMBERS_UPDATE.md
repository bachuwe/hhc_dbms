## Technical Details

### Database Schema Changes
- `date_of_birth`: DATE field, nullable
- `employment_status`: ENUM('APPRENTICESHIP', 'EMPLOYED', 'UNEMPLOYED'), nullable

### Form Validation
- Date of birth: HTML5 date validation
- Employment status: Dropdown validation (no custom input allowed)
- Both fields are optional and can be left empty

### Data Handling
- Date of birth is stored in MySQL DATE format (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Employment status is stored as one of the three ENUM values
- NULL values are allowed for both fields (backward compatibility)

## Backward Compatibility
- Existing member records will have NULL values for the new fields
- All existing functionality remains unchanged
- Old member records can be updated with new information through the edit feature

## Next Steps
1. Run the database update script
2. Test adding new members with the new fields
3. Test editing existing members
4. Verify search functionality with employment status filter

The system is now ready to handle the additional member information as requested.
